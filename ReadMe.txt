Welcome to Math++, your personal arithmetic battling application, or a place to develop your rudimentary math skills! The game allows you to listen to a soothing song while you play, and you can also place a picture to place on your home screen.

INSTALLATION:
The primary method to interact with this app is through an android emulator running on android studio. During development, android API level 28 was used to test, and a Pixel XL 2 was emulated. Upon testing, Android versions as far back as 22 were able to run the application with no problem, but a resolution of 1440 x 2880 is recommended to prevent ui errors. 

Installation is simple, download the project from GitHub, unzip the file into your android studio project folder, and then open the project through android studio. From there, download the Pie (Level 28) from the SDK manager, and create an emulator with the specifications recommended above. Next, simple build the project and run it on the emulator.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
Once the game is running on your favorite emulator, you can click on the instructions button to be told how to play the game, a settings icon in the top right corner to turn music off and on, a camera in the top left corner to customize your home screen. After that, the get calculating button allows the user to navigate to the arithmetic game location. 

Once in the game, clicking the GO! button once starts the timer, and the user can begin answering questions. A correct answer rewards one point, an incorrect answer gives no points. Quantity over quality here - get them right, but you aren't punished for incorrect answers. 

CONTACT:
If for some silly reason you want to contact the people who made this app, you can do so through this GitHub page, or you can email Myles Lewis at mglewis@bu.edu and I can get you in contact with various other members of the team

LICENSING:
Eh, do what you want with it. Probably don't use it for your own school project, because of plagiarism and stuff, but really we don't care.
